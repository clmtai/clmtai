# ClmtAI
The red pill Generative AI model that show us what our future world will look like in
different climate change scenarios. ClmtAI will allow us to ask natural language models
to query how a place on the world will look like in the future under different scenarios.
To provide the answers, the ClmtAI will leverage AI climate models, satellite imagery, 
and existing landscape and cityscape photography and videography. 

Below follows a mock up query that demonstrate the funcionality of ClmtAI.

## Current status

We are just starting our journey! We will start as a free project, it is possible that some parts of the 
projects may be spun off as commercial enterprises to help companies and individuals better prepare 
for the impact of climate change.

## Tasks for new joiners
If you want to join, here are some of the things we could be working on:
 
  - create onboarding guide to learn about Geospatial data analysis
  - create onboarding guide to learn about LLM fine tuning
  - create onboarding guide to learn about Generative AI models to create photorealistic images
  - create onboarding guide to learn about climate modeling with AI

and much much more!

## History

My, [Anton Bossenbroek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abossen/) interest for Climate change and how we
communicate it comes from my passion for the outdoors and landscape photography. For an ongoing project on 
light pollution in the Netherlands, I started to develop a python package to analyse artificial light 
at night (ALAN). The package [pyalanisys](https://github.com/pyalanysis/pyalanysis) has been a bit 
in the mothballs due to a company that I founded. The summer of 2023 isn't yet finished and the incredible
spikes in climate extremes that we have [witnessed this year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/summer-of-2023-hottest-recorded-in-wake-up-call-to-cut-carbon-emissions)
made me really reconsider what I spend my time on.
