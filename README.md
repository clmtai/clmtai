# ClmtAI
The red pill Generative AI model that show us what our future world will look like in
different climate change scenarios. ClmtAI will allow a user to ask using
natural language how a place on the world will look in the future under
different scenarios. To provide the answers, the ClmtAI model will leverage AI
climate models, satellite imagery, and existing landscape and cityscape
photography and videography. 

Below follows a mock up query that demonstrate the funcionality of ClmtAI.

## Current status

We are just starting our journey! We will start as a open source project, it is
possible that some parts of the projects may be spun off as commercial
enterprises to help governments, NGOs, companies and/or individuals better
prepare for the impact of climate change.

## Tasks for new joiners
If you want to join, here are some of the things we could be working on:
 
  - create onboarding guide to learn about Geospatial data analysis
  - create onboarding guide to learn about LLM fine tuning
  - create onboarding guide to learn about Generative AI models to create photorealistic images
  - create onboarding guide to learn about climate modeling with AI
  - create onboarding guide how to consume less energy with computing

and much much more! 

What you will get:

 - work on a problem that is very actual
 - learn new technology
 - work with an inspiring team where we want to improve the world

We welcome any background ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ!

## History

My, [Anton Bossenbroek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abossen/) interest for Climate change and how we
communicate it comes from my passion for the outdoors and landscape photography. For an ongoing project on 
light pollution in the Netherlands, I started to develop a python package to analyse artificial light 
at night (ALAN). The package [pyalanisys](https://github.com/pyalanysis/pyalanysis) has been a bit 
in the mothballs due to a company that I founded. The summer of 2023 isn't yet finished and the incredible
spikes in climate extremes that we have [witnessed this year](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/summer-of-2023-hottest-recorded-in-wake-up-call-to-cut-carbon-emissions)
made me really reconsider what I spend my time on.

Prior to starting this company I worked over 14 years developing and deploying
AI models for large companies throughout the world. Part of my experience was on deploying machine 
learning models to reduce downtime such as catastrophic failure in heavy
industries such as the Oil & Gas industry. I went in hoping to see that saved money would be invested
in the energy transition, unfortunately that was not the case. These
observations lead me to start my own company.
